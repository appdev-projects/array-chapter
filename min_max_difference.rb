# Using the given Array of numbers numbers, output the number with the lowest value in
# the array, the number with the highest value in the array, and the difference
# between the highest value and the lowest value.
# 
# The program should have three separate print statements:

#   highest_number
#   difference

array = [12, 23, 41, 73, 19, 6]


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# min_max_difference.rb should output '6', '73', and '67' on separate lines
